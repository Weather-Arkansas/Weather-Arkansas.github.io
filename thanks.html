<h2>History of Weather Arkansas</h2>
<p>My older brother was coding one day, and I wanted to try too. I made my first site called <strong>Clock World</strong>, using clocks from Time and Date. Then I changed it to a game site, embedding games from Scratch and Wordwall, and experimented with many other things — this site was called <strong>Eclipsed</strong> and included Sims and a variety of other projects.</p>

<p>Later, I had an idea: why not make a weather website? Since I live in Arkansas, I started gathering data from Arkansas weather stations. AI tools helped speed up the process, and the site became live. After receiving some publicity, I renamed it <strong>Weather Arkansas</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, I am truly thankful for everyone who has visited, supported, and inspired me along the way. Your presence here makes Weather Arkansas possible!</p>
